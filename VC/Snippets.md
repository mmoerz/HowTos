# Snippets

## Step before defining a new Code Snippet
Check if the code snippet shortcut already exists:
In VC type CTRL+J, use the filter bar at the end of the drop down to only show
snippets (outmost right symbol) and check that the drop down doesn't contain
the new shortcut.

## Visual Studio Code

VSCode is only used as a text editor here.
create new file with ending ```.snippet```
Change the contenttype to xml: click on Plaintext and type xml and select it

Notes on the code:
- shortcut is the text that gets expanded on hitting TAB, TAB
- Code Language e.g.:
  - CSharp
  - html


## Import in Visual Studio

Tools -> Code Snippet Manager
  select Language
  select File

  Place it in ```MyCodeSnippets```

## Snippet template

```
```
